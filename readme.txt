Welcome to We Can Fly! This project has been developed to address what looks like a petty issue to many of us. While researching for a project that would empower women health and safety in India, we came across shocking statistics seeing which we realised Education is the first step towards empowerment and we plan to address this issue by providing sanitary supplies esp. Sanitary pads to the school going girls who are either unaware of them or who cannot afford them. 


This project has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. The homepage is index.php. The sample database is provided in the folder. If you are having any compatibility issues, please visit www.wecanfly.in for proper understanding of the flow. 


The following explains the work-flow and functionality of the project:


There is a homepage with 5 sections. There are 4 user roles. Each of them has a separate registration page and a separate login type.


School Officials are the people who will register using their school name, state, district and city (City is used only for the volunteers). They can upload their student list. The template of how the file should be is attached in their dashboard. They can download it, modify it and upload it. They can[a] modify this list anytime they want. They can then request for the stock. This stock request goes to the Govt. Officer incharge of that particular district. Once they receive the stock, they can confirm the receipt of stock.


Government Officials: Each district has one Government Officer, he/she can register using their name, state and district they work for. The stock requests from all the schools present in their district are shown on their dashboards. They can view them and forward them to the manufacturing companies for a price quote. Once they receive a price quote from the manufacturing companies, they can approve the ones they think are appropriate (I didn’t choose to do the one with the minimum amount by default because I felt there are other things more important than the price, like we might encourage companies in the rural areas even if their quote is higher).


Manufacturing Companies: They can register using only their names. All the manufacturing companies registered will receive a request for the price quote no matter what district they are in. They quote a price and submit to the government.


Volunteers: They register using their name,city and other basic details. They can choose a city (not necessarily where they live), the school they want to visit, and can schedule an appointment using the calendar built-in the dashboard, they can view the student list in all the schools of various cities, they can view their schedules too. They can visit the schools to either educate the students/parents or to distribute the supplies.
